This is my final project. I used NodeJs, Express, EJS & MongoDB for this Blog.

Express: Handling HTTP requests and routes.
MongoDB: Database for storing and retrieving data.
Middleware: Used for session management, form parsing.
Route definition using Express.
MongoDB integration for data operations.
Session management setup.

npm installs like mongoose, "bcrypt", "connect-mongo", "cookie-parser","dotenv":,"ejs", "express", "express-ejs-layouts", "express-session",  "jsonwebtoken", "method-override", "mongo-sanitize","mongodb", "mongoose",    "react-icons", "session", and "sort-by".
